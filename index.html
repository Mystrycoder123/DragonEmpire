<b class="text"><u>About</u></b>

<p ><I>Ryuga is a character and a villain-turned-Anti-Hero-turned-hero 
  from the anime "Beyblade: Metal Fusion" and "Beyblade: Metal Masters",
   Although initially Ryuga was not a villain at all,
    Ryuga, a man with the Forbidden Bey known as Lightning L-Drago.
     he is the powerful brave and the owner of <b>L-Drago</b>. He is portrayed 
     to be pure evil and shows no mercy to his allies or enemies,
  he loves to attack the beys of his enemies until the bey is crushed. 
 He also enjoys terrorizing other beybladers and has a power-hungry 
 personality. Although in episode 51 it is revealed that Ryuga's behaviour 
 was caused by L-Drago's possession over him.(Ryuga turns into a dragon) 
  Although when he has Meteo L-Drago he has much more control over himself;
   this may be because he has full control over Meteo or that he is hiding its 
   true power. With L-Drago Destroy, he won all the time, until when
    he encountered Rago. Ryuga was knocked unconscious as he groaned.
     He had scratches all over his body, and L-Drago Destroy was destroyed.
      Eventually, Ryuga passed on his star fragment to Kenta, 
     which helped Flame Sagittario evolve into Flash Sagittario.
     He owns the mystical Lightning L-Drago 100HF, referred to as the
      "Forbidden Bey" (禁断のベイ, Kindan no Bei). He is Gingka's ultimate rival.
       Coincidentally, he keeps his beyblade on his arm with a gauntlet 
       shaped like a dragon from the Asian legends. 
     He is part of the Dark Nebula organization.hen Ryūga first appeared in the anime, he is seen inside a capsule in a coma.

     In episode 12, Gingka and Pegasus' presence in the area allowed him to wake up. In episode 13, Gingka challenged him to a bey battle when he confronted him. They fought on the stadium often used by the Dark Nebula, and with his insulting and taunting comments to the protagonist, Gingka was easily distracted and furious. This caused the event in where he was able to restore Ryūga's power. With his energy back to 100%, he won the battle effortlessly with his final attack from L-Drago, leaving Gingka in shock that he lost to him and Pegasus in scratches. In episode 15, he was shown training against Dark Nebula bladers, who owned all the different types of Beyblades, Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Balance.
     
     One day Doji takes Ryuga to meet a powerful, young blader named Yu Tendo in the desert. After he beats Yu Yu gets invited to join the Dark Nebula which the kid accepts. Yu wins the survival battle and creates a tournament called Battle Bladders'. Ryuga and the Dark Nebula arrive to they island where he confronts Gingka to let him know that the WBBA's battle bladers tournament is where Gingka will be able to receive his rematch if he makes it far enough to the finals. Doji also says that when Ryuga wins the tournament he will be the King of all Bladers. Ryuga starts to prepare L-Drago for it by smashing some rocks and winning a one hundred way battle (Benkei was included in those hundred). After beating a blader in a challenge match he ambushes Tobio and Ryutaro right before their battle. He challenges both of them at the same time and wins. then he invites them to join the Dark Nebula and they accept. When the Dark Nebula finds out that Tsubasa is a traitor, he battles him. He is about to defeat Tsubasa with Dragon Emperor Soaring Bite Strike, but Phoenix interferes and saves Tsubasa
     
     The tournament arrives in no time, Ryuga accompanying Doji in most cases. His first match was with Hikaru, whom he easily dominated, infuriating the WBBA Spy, Tsubasa Otori. Later he is seen defeating the Dark Nebula bladers who failed in the first round and leaves Yu to suffer by Reiji. In the second round Ryuga battles Tsubasa next and ends with the same outcome after transferring Ryuga's own Negative energy onto Tsubasa, cursing him with the Dark Power.
     
     With such a close match with Tsubasa, Doji feels concerned that Ryuga may not be able to defeat Gingka and as a compromise, Ryuga drains the negative energy from Doji's body, supposedly killing him.
     
     In the semi-finals, he battles Kyoya and wins after an intense fight despite Kyoya's determination to beat Ryuga and win against Gingka
     
     With his energy replenished he continues to his final match with Gingka Hagane. Ryuga's negative energy overflows as L-Drago is able to possess Ryuga's body during the battle. Gingka's Pegasus sacrificed itself to destroy its Dark counterpart, defeating Ryuga and destroying the evil Bey.
     
     
     Ryuga saved by Ginga
     
     After his final match up with Gingka, Ryuga went into rigorous 
     training with Lightning L-Drago to to rid himself of the dark Bey's 
     control. He eventually figured out that L-Drago's evil was really created 
     by its past owners. These owners were people filled with greed, 
     and hungry for power. Through time, these negative traits formed into 
     the dark power of L-Drago. Ryuga reasoned out that because the dark power 
     
     was created by humans such as himself, he should be able to overcome it. 
     Through his training he eventually became
      one with the dark power and both he and L-Drago were reborn.Ryuga is convinced to return to the scene when he is visited by Hyoma and notified of Gingka's struggle to control the strength of Galaxy Pegasus. Ryuga finds out on his journey that the dark power has infected Tsubasa, and interrupts Tsubasa's match with Sophie and Wales to reveal his new, stronger powers.

      Ryuga also finds out about the second Left Rotating Beyblade, Julian Konzern's Gravity Destroyer. Ryuga proclaims that he has the strongest and then proceeds to explain his rebirth to Tsubasa. Having enough of the European Team, he drags Tsubasa back to his teammates and confronts Gingka.
      
      Ryuga challenges Gingka to a rematch since their last battle and they battle on the outskirts of town, forcing him to leave his Team as they continue their world championship journey. Ryuga easily overwhelms Gingka while discussing that Meteo L-Drago is the strongest left-rotation Bey in the world, disappointed that Gingka hasn't mastered Galaxy Pegasus' power. As Gingka's match with Julian draws near Ryuga calls back his L-Drago and commands Gingka to leave, but not without telling him first that he needs to master Pegasus' power if he wants to defeat a left rotating Beyblade.
      
      Ryuga followed Team Gan Gan Galaxy into the United States to further study Tsubasa and Gingka but during his travels he was threatened by several hooded Beybladers. Ryuga used his hand to spin his Bey and easily defeated the Bladers who claimed to be from HD Academy. Impressed by Ryuga's skills, a mysterious hooded man then confronts him.
      
      This man is revealed to be Jack of Team Starbreaker (the US team) who leads Ryuga to HD Academy for "testing" to view L-Drago's left spin capabilities. Even though he participated, Ryuga only desired to face Jack, interested through all his talk but Jack tells him that his Bey is not completed yet. As a compromise Jack offers Ryuga a match with Zeo Abyss as the next best thing.
      
      Ryuga decides to battle Zeo but becomes unimpressed by his skills. Even though Zeo tries his hardest, Ryuga easily defeats him and prepares to leave. He is stoped by Dr. Ziggurat, who tells Ryuga to cooperate with the academy so they could learn about L-Drago and help to complete the Arrangement System.
      
      In order to win Ryuga's trust, Dr. Ziggurat reveals that he was working with the Dark Nebula and originally used Ryuga as a test subject. But in that one final offer to join the Academy as a test subject, Ryuga is infuriated by Ziggurat's comment about his past and responds by fiercely blowing a hole in the building with his L-Drago and leaves in the wake of his destruction.
      
      Ryuga is later tracked down by Zeo and several HD Beybladers who want to apprehend him and force him to be tested by the arrangement. Ryuga prepares to fend him off until they are interrupted by the arrival of Gingka and his teammate Masamune. Masamune tries to help Zeo but is stopped by Gingka who realizes that Ryuga is actually in the right, and helps to stop Zeo. Ryuga decides to leave the scene after warning Gingka to watch out for the US Team, already knowing they're up to something.
      
      During the Big Bang Bladers Championship, Gan Gan Galaxy was short two members due to Yu and Tsubasa's injuries sustained from the mysterious Damian Hart. Gingka was prepared to step up in the second match to face Jack, hoping to win two battles in a row by himself.
      
      But Ryuga was ready to gain payback against Hades Inc, and interrupts the tournament to step up as Gan Gan Galaxy's replacement member. Masamune worries about trusting Ryuga but Gingka reassures him by telling him that Ryuga is doing this for his own goals.
      
      Because Ryuga is not of age and had not participated in the tournament, he is eligible to step up and he is given the green light to face Jack. Their match begins as Jack seems to already know part of what Ryuga is a capable of. Ryuga is not moved by this as he knows he has much in store for the artistic Blader.
      
      Jack expresses his uncanny taste for the arts as he appears to unleash his abilities apon Ryuga. Jack also claims that Ryuga is too much of a brute to understand his beauty, but Ryuga remains calm as he waits out Jack's attacks one after another. Everyone begins to fear Ryuga's self destruction, but after Jack releases all of his powers, Ryuga reveals that he was trying to measure his strength and kicks his L-Drago into gear. Ryuga releases his counter attack against Jack who he feels is no match for himself. Though Jack becomes furious and fights back, Ryuga is confident that he cannot lose to someone who uses "pet food" to get stronger rather then true training.
      
      Using his Beyblader spirit, Ryuga overcomes the odds and makes Jack into his own work of art, defeating him with L-Drago's new special move; Dragon Emperor Supreme Flight. After obtaining Gan Gan Galaxy's first victory for them and showing Hades Inc not to mess with him, Ryuga leaves without a word.
      
      Ryuga remains in America long enough to hear Ziggurat's announcement on the Spiral Force; interested, Ryuga moves in to stop him. Ryuga does not move quickly enough as he discovers the hard way that Hades City has already taken flight above the ocean, but this does not stop Ryuga who uses his L-Drago to infiltrate it. Once inside he meets with Gingka at the very core of the weapon, he uses his L-Drago to damage it while Gingka uses his Pegasus to transfer the energy lost into space, stopping the core and saving the world together.
      
      Ryuga is seen approaching two guards in Zarkan Island. The guards would not let him in but Ryuga had other reasons. He used the power of Meteo L-Drago to attack the guards ferociously. However, a light beam from the Star Fragment hit Meteo L-Drago. This caused it to evolve into L-Drago Destroy F:S . The villagers were frightened of L-Drago's amazing power and thus banished Beyblades from their entire village.
      
      During Kyoya and Benkei's travel to the Zarkan Island volcano they were confronted by none other than Ryuga himself. Ryuga challenged Kyoya and pinned Legend Bey vs Legend Bey. Kyoya tries his best to push L-Drago into the volcano with Fang Leone 130W2D but fails and Ryuga easily overwhelms Kyoya.
      
      After Kyoya's loss to Ryuga, Gingka battles him and then Yuki. Ryuga defeats them both even after Yuki shows off his true power as a Legendary Blader. After he claims three wins Ryuga leaves in order to search for the Legendary Bladers and become the strongest Blader in the world.
      
      Afterwards Ryuga was confronted by Kenta Yumiya Kenta told Ryuga that he is a Legendary Blader, and challenged him to a battle. Ryuga easily defeated him, and seeing that Kenta was faking it, he left. Kenta asked him to help Gingka and the others, but Ryuga refused. But Kenta followed him, and said that until he helps Gingka, he will keep following Ryuga. When Kenta tried to catch a fish, but failed, Ryuga still gave him some food, to Kenta's surprise. Ryuga then then told him to leave after eating. Kenta begins to cry loudly, and begs him to help Gingka and the others. When Ryuga asked why he is doing this, Kenta said that it is the only way he can help them: by convincing Ryuga to help them. Ryuga then told Kenta to keep challenging him, and see if Kenta can make him serious.
      
      Ryuga later participated in a "The Tower of Babel" Beyblade Tournament near the Mohenjo-Daro ruins. He randomly appeared in order to test his strength against several Beybladers at once. He was first confronted by Kenta, who he ignored.
      
      Ryuga defeated several Bladers with ease until he reached the top of the tower when he was soon followed by the other Finalist, Tsubasa Otori. The two battled it out as Tsubasa tried his hardest to make Ryuga fight with all his power but failed. After Tsubasa uses his special move, Ryuga uses his Special Move, "Dragon Emperor Life Destructor", and surprisingly easily overwhelms Tsubasa's strongest special move, "Shining Tornado Buster". Thus wining the tornment. After this, Ryuga was given the winning prize, but he crushes it with his foot and leaves unsatified.
      
      
      Ryuga and Kenta arrive at the Beystar Island tournament where they are met by several other Beybladers including Gingka. Ryuga and Kenta separate and Ryuga runs into his first "challenge" known as the Blader, King. Ryuga and King battle too ferociously, revealing that King is able to combat Ryuga on equal ground after revealing his Legend powers. Ryuga only takes the win after using a glimpse of his full power in his special move.
      
      
      He later interrupts the battle at the end of the tournament by trying to steal Chris,s Star Fragments power which he fails to do.
      
      When Nemesis awakened, Ryuga's L-Drago began glowing. Ryuga claims to feel the power of Nemesis calling to him, and departs. When Kenta realized what he was doing, he tried to stop Ryuga, and reminded him that he might fail like the time with Lightning L-Drago. Ryuga throws him away, so Kenta challenges Ryuga, Ryuga easily defeats Kenta without breaking a sweat but Kenta's newfound durability allows him to stand up and challenge Ryuga once more.
      
      Ryuga accepts and battles Kenta to the point where he is surprised by Kenta's Diving Claw but counters with his own special move. Ryuga wins but finds that his L-Drago's facebolt was cracked revealing that Kenta was strong enough to damage L-Drago. Ryuga leaves Kenta but is surely followed by him soon after.
      Ryuga appears again, interrupting a battle between Johannes, Bao and the Beylin Fist versus Zeo, Toby and Benkei by using his L-Drago to clear a straight path into the ruins. He enters the ruins, and barges into the middle of Gingka's confrontation with Rago, Pluto, and Doji. While Gingka, Chris and Kyoya battle Rago, Ryuga enters the match and unwillingly creates Zeus' Barrier, which stops Rago in his tracks. Doji, an old enemy of Ryuga's, baits him into attacking Rago, destroying the barrier. The ruins collapsed seemingly trapping Ryuga inside.

      Once free he vows to get revenge on Doji and defeat Nemesis.
      
      Ryuga reappeared at Nemesis' hideout and challenged Rago to a battle, At first Ryuga puts Rago on the defensive in their battle, but then Nemesis started to retaliate. Despite Doji's taunts, Ryuga continued to battle Rago but soon enough, L-Drago was pushed to its limit, forcing Ryuga to use all of his energy, as well as his unwavering Blader's Spirit.
      
      Ryuga summoned a Special Move that he put his heart and soul into. However, Ryuga's attempt was in vain as Rago overpowers him with his own Special Move that obliterated Ryuga's hopes of winning, dealing Ryuga a crushing defeat, and leaving Gingka and the others stunned.
      
      Ryuga wakes during Kenta's against battle Rago and Nemesis. When Ryuga woke up, he told Kenta that there was a time when he had faced his challenge seriously.
      
      Ryuga then gives his Legend Blader power to Kenta by launching L-Drago and circling Sagittario. This helped Flame Sagittario evolve into Flash Sagittario, thus making him one of the Legendary Bladers. After Ryuga gave up his powers, he and L-Drago disintegrate due to the fact that the star fragment was the only thing preventing this from happening earlier. After Nemesis and Rago are defeated, Gingka thanks Ryuga for all of his help and pays him respects. Ryuga watches over them all from above.  .You can get more imformation about him in this website.</p>
